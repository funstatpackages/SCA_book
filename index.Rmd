# Preface

## What you will learn

This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.

## Prerequisites

## Data Sets Used in Labs and Exercises

In this textbook, we illustrate statistical learning methods using applications
from marketing, finance, biology, and other areas. The ISLR package available on the book website contains a number of data sets that are required in order to perform the labs and exercises associated with this book. One other data set is contained in the MASS library, and yet another is part of the base R distribution. Table 1.1 contains a summary of the data
sets required to perform the labs and exercises. A couple of these data sets
are also available as text files on the book website, for use in Chapter 2.

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
